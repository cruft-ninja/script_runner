Yes, you can absolutely configure the **Continue** plugin to use Gemini. Since Continue is an open-source extension, it allows you to swap out the default models for your own API-powered ones.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have your **Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

---

### **How to Configure Gemini in Continue**

1. **Open the Config File:**
* In VS Code, click the **Continue icon** in the sidebar.
* Click the **gear icon (Settings)** at the bottom of the Continue pane. This will open your `config.json` (or `config.yaml` in newer versions).


2. **Add Gemini to the `models` list:**
Paste the following block into the `"models"` array. Replace `<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>` with the key you generated.
**For `config.json` (Standard):**
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Gemini 2.0 Flash",
      "provider": "gemini",
      "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
      "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    },
    {
      "title": "Gemini 1.5 Pro",
      "provider": "gemini",
      "model": "gemini-1.5-pro",
      "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    }
  ]
}

```


3. **Save and Reload:**
Save the file. Continue should automatically reload. You can now select "Gemini 2.0 Flash" or "Gemini 1.5 Pro" from the model dropdown at the bottom of the Continue chat window.

---

### **Recommended Setup for Best Performance**

If you want the full experience (chat, autocomplete, and code editing), you can assign different Gemini models to specific roles in your `config.json`:

* **Chat:** Use `gemini-1.5-pro` for complex reasoning.
* **Autocomplete:** Use `gemini-2.0-flash` because it is significantly faster for inline suggestions.

```json
"tabAutocompleteModel": {
  "title": "Gemini Autocomplete",
  "provider": "gemini",
  "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
}

```

### **Troubleshooting Tips**

* **SSL Errors:** If you are behind a corporate proxy, remember to enable the `http.systemCertificatesNode` setting in VS Code as we discussed earlier.
* **Model IDs:** Ensure you are using the correct model strings (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash` or `gemini-1.5-flash`). You can find the latest IDs in the [Google AI Studio documentation](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini).

Would you like me to help you set up a specific model for **Tab Autocomplete** as well?
